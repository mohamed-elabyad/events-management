# Events Management API

A production-ready RESTful API built with **Laravel 12** for managing users, events, and attendees.  
It supports flexible data loading, secure authentication, authorization, scheduled jobs, and email notifications.

---

## Features
- **Authentication**: Register, login, and logout with Laravel Sanctum.
- **Events Management**: Full CRUD with ownership rules and pagination.
- **Attendees Management**: Users can join or leave events via nested routes.
- **Authorization**: Policies restrict updates/deletes to the resource owner.
- **Flexible Includes**: Endpoints support `?include=` to eager load relations (`owner`, `attendees`) using a custom `loadRelations()` method.
- **Notifications**: Email reminders are sent to all attendees one day before event start.
- **Scheduling**: Custom Artisan command scheduled via Laravel Scheduler to trigger reminders automatically.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttled API routes for security.
- **Email Testing**: Integrated with [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) to preview and monitor outgoing emails safely.
